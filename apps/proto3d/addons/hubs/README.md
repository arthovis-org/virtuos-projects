# Client Hubs (`hubs`, prefix `hub-`)

A demo of how Imagine OS builds a complete client deliverable hub on the Proto3D canvas: the public website, the customer app, the staff surfaces by role, the ops manual, docs, plan, design system and dev tools, mockups and the machine surface, **embedded live as nodes**, with the canvas re-arrangeable into different flows. Five real clients on imagine-os.github.io are included: CTL OS (`cal-tenant-law`, tenant law firm), Petrock (`petrock`, dog hotel and spa), HoyOS (`hoy`, wellness center, Spanish), Llave OS (`dorum-lifestyle`, real-estate agency, a static multi-page site) and Aluzina (`aluzina`, interior design studio in Medellín; 24 pages, iframe-embeddable like the others).

## What is on the canvas

| Node | Size | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hub-blueprint` | XL | The "fill in a client" form: name, slug, brand, language, base URL, industry, roles, the eleven-section checklist with page counts and a **Generate pages** button (Regenerate when pages exist). Outputs `pages` (descriptors), `tasks` (`data · tasks`, one card per enabled section in the core PM shape), `count`, `generated` (event). Input `generate` (event). |
| `hub-page` | per card | One deliverable page: `url`, `title`, `section`, `audience`, `role`, `device` (desktop / tablet / phone / none), `status` (planned / building / live), `live`, `client`, `order`, plus its size: `height` (world units, 0 = follow the global embed height), `aspect` (page width preset: device / desktop 1280 / tablet 1024 / phone 390 / custom) and `pageWidth` (px, for custom). A `body3d` card sized per instance: the width of the page, the global or its own height. The canvas face (a slim strip: section, audience · role, route, status; then the page frame or phone bezel) is the fallback whenever the live frame is not shown. Clicking the face emits `opened` and opens the page for interaction; the `open` event input does the same. |
| `hub-section` | M | A header card (section name, audience, description) the flows use as a lane / column label. |

**Hubs menu**: Demos (one per client, all four in the Compare flow, a blank New client), Arrange (five flows), Embed height (presets), Live pages (on/off, budget), Open selected page, Generate pages for the selected blueprint. **Panel section "Client Hubs"**: the embed-height slider, live toggle, budget slider, counts, flow buttons. **Flow bar** (bottom-centre HUD): the five flows, a client filter when several clients are on the canvas, the embed-height slider with its value, the live counter.

## Card sizes (`src/sizing.js`)

A page card is **the width of the page**: the iframe renders the page at its natural CSS width for the device and is scaled so that width fills the card's frame exactly; the card's height decides how much of the page is visible (the iframe's CSS height equals the frame's height at that scale, so the visible viewport is the whole frame: no letterbox, no crop to a band).

| Kind | Page width | Card | Default frame (at embed height 8) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| desktop (`device: desktop / none`, `aspect: desktop`) | 1280 px | 8.6 × 8 units | 1280 × ~1080 px of page |
| tablet | 1024 px | 7.0 × 8 | 1024 × ~1080 px |
| phone | 390 px | 3.4 × 8, with a bezel | the whole 390 × 844 page (and a little more) |
| custom (`aspect: custom`, `pageWidth`) | 240–2560 px | `pageWidth · 0.75 / 120 + 0.6` wide | width fills the frame |

The **embed height** (slider in the flow bar and the panel, presets in the Hubs menu; 4–14 units, default 8, persisted in `host.storage`) resizes every card at once: each card re-bakes its slab, face surface, rim, shadow, ports and title on the next frame (`body3d.refresh`), and the CSS3D frames are rebuilt for the new face size. It is a view setting, not a history entry. A card's own `height` param wins over the global value. `getAABB`, LOD, selection outline, gizmo and cable routing follow the new size; the size is a function of the params, so serialize → load reproduces it (and `rotationY` keeps the flow's angle). The face canvas stays under `sizes.face.maxSide` (4096) at the 4× tier: a default desktop face is 1008 × 881 logical px; `createSurface` clamps the tier for taller cards.

## The deliverable process as nodes

`blueprint → pages → tasks → plan`. A blueprint holds the client; **Generate** turns it into `hub-page` nodes (real routes for the four known slugs from `src/clients.js`, template defaults with status `planned` for any other slug) placed in the Delivery flow beside the blueprint, as one undoable command (Ctrl+Z removes them all). Regenerating removes the client's old pages first and keeps a status you edited by hand. The `tasks` output ("Public website for Petrock", …) is in the shape `src/pm/model.js` uses for cards (`id, title, description, assignee, due, priority, tags, checklist, estimate, createdAt, movedAt, blockedBy, column, done`), so the core **Timeline**, **Person** and **Project Dashboard** consume it directly; the demo wires it into a Timeline. The core **Kanban Board has no `tasks` input** (it owns its cards), so the demo pre-fills a board's `board` param with the same tasks as cards instead of forcing a link.

## Static previews (`assets/previews/`, `tools/capture-previews.mjs`)

A card's screen always shows its page: the face draws a **static preview image** of the page into the frame rect (cover-fit, top-aligned so the page header shows, a soft fade at the bottom) whenever it is loaded, at any zoom, angle or distance, with or without a live iframe on top (the iframe's backgrounds are transparent, so there is no white flash before the page paints). Previews live at `assets/previews/<slug>/<page-id>.jpg` (`pageId(route)`: `#/site/proposal` → `site-proposal`, `#/` → `index`; `previewPath` / `previewFor` in `clients.js`), ~800 px wide (phone 390), JPEG q78, about 60 kB each. They load lazily (`Image`, cached per path) and mark the face dirty when they arrive; planned pages, unknown clients and missing images keep the placeholder (a light-grey frame with a thin border). 89 of the 89 pages have one (all); about 4.3 MB in total. A hub-page's `preview` param points at another image if needed.

Regenerate them (Chromium, real network; desktop 1280 × 1080, tablet 1024 × 1100, phone 390 × 844; waits for the SPA to render):

```
node addons/hubs/tools/capture-previews.mjs            # every client
node addons/hubs/tools/capture-previews.mjs petrock    # one client
```

**LOD.** The core marks blocks past 110 units as far and lifts their titles; `hub-page` and `hub-blueprint` instances override `setLOD` (`onCreate`) so their faces stay drawn at every distance: a page card is its content.

## Occlusion, in one paragraph

Why the extra work: `CSS3DRenderer` positions real DOM elements with a `matrix3d` over the canvas, so they have no depth against WebGL meshes. The static previews on the canvas faces are the depth-correct fallback; the occlusion test (below) decides when a live frame must yield to them. The rule: **a live frame hides when anything sits between it and the camera; the preview takes over.**

## The live layer (`src/live-layer.js`)

A `CSS3DRenderer` (three/addons, the same three 0.160 the core loads) draws a DOM layer inside `#viewport` above the WebGL canvas, rendered every frame with the core's current camera (`ws.camera` is a getter; the Navigator's orthographic swap is followed). Every live-eligible `hub-page` gets a `<div class="hub-live">` holding a browser-chrome strip, a screen and an `<iframe loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups">`, scaled by `1 / 120` (`sizes.face.pxPerUnit`) and positioned on the node's face mesh world transform, nudged 0.01 along the face normal. `faceLayout(params, cw, ch)` in `sizing.js` gives both the canvas face and the DOM element the same frame rectangle, so a phone iframe (390 px wide, scaled into the drawn bezel), a tablet (1024) or a desktop page (1280) lands exactly where the face drew its frame, as tall as the frame.

* **Budget.** Only the N biggest on-screen pages (projected area) with `live = true` and `status = live` get an iframe (default 16, "All" = 40; menu / panel, persisted in `host.storage`). The ranking runs 4× a second with hysteresis (a live page counts as 25 % bigger) so frames do not thrash. Others show the canvas card with its preview. An element out of the budget for 20 s is dropped (its iframe unloads); the `src` is set once when a node becomes live, never per frame.
* **Hidden when** the face turns past ~85° from the camera (cos 0.09 on, 0.05 off: hysteresis; Chromium renders CSS3D planes fine up to there, and the static preview shows beyond), off-screen, under 10 px on screen, the node is hidden (collapsed group), or live frames are off. In the 2D plan the cards lie flat and the layer follows them (top-down, orthographic).
* **Interaction.** The layer is `pointer-events: none`, so dragging, selecting and the camera work as usual. A click on a page face (core raycast → `face.onPointer`) makes that one element interactive: `pointer-events: auto`, an accent outline, a Done button, wheel events kept from the camera, and the camera flies to face the page at ~70 % of the viewport (the `facingPose` idea from `ui/field-editor.js`). Done, Escape or a pointerdown on the WebGL canvas leave. `window.__addon.api.interact(uid)` does the same for tests.
* **Occlusion.** A DOM layer is always painted over the WebGL scene, so on its own a live frame behind a nearer block (the Timeline, the build board, another card) would show through it. The layer therefore tests, a few times a second, whether anything sits between the camera and each live face: five sample points (the centre and four inset 15 % from the corners) are raycast against every other block whose box overlaps the card on screen (`src/occlusion.js`); if any sample hits another block first, the frame hides (`visibility: hidden`, the iframe stays loaded) after two consecutive passes and shows again after one clear pass, and the canvas face with its static preview, which does respect depth, takes over. A half-covered frame hides too. The frame the user is interacting with stays visible (the camera flew to face it) and is re-checked on exit. The pass raycasts only the live set against pre-filtered blocks; its cost is in the panel counts (`occlusionMs`).
* **Limits.** Cross-origin pages cannot be read, styled or screenshotted; the add-on never tries. A page whose `status` is not `live` never loads a frame. Iframe text is rendered by the browser under a `matrix3d` transform, so it is crisp only when the face is roughly screen-parallel.

## Flows (`src/flows.js`)

Pure functions: `layoutFlow(id, items) → Map uid → { x, y, z, ry }` — x / z the block's centre, **y the elevation of its base** (0 = the floor; callers add height / 2 + 0.4), ry the rotation about y. Items carry their real footprint (`width`, `height`; page cards default to `cardDims`), so tall cards get taller levels: every level clears the tallest card below it plus a 1.6-unit margin (`levelBases`). Height is an organising axis, not a stagger. Deterministic in the items' order; collision-free by construction (`collides` is the test's check).

| Flow | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery | a climbing arc per client (a level each) with **one slot per section**: the section's header or first page on the ground arc (sweep ≤ 137°, radius ≥ 12, cards facing the arc's centre, later phases up to 4 units higher), its other pages rising above that slot in a short column; the blueprint front-centre inside the arc. A 21-page hub is a 74 × 23 unit arc, so framing the whole arc stays under the LOD distance and the faces stay readable |
| Audience | floors: customers at the ground, then everyone, staff, owner, developers, machine; each floor a centred row stepped back 3.2 units, narrow (phone) cards a step forward; headers at the left end of their floor, blueprints climbing the floors at the far left |
| Site map | the hub page at the base, the sections as a semicircular ring one level up behind it (each slot facing the hub), the section's remaining pages rising above their slot in a column that also steps outward |
| Compare | clients as levels with **a full card height of air** between them (plus the 1.6 margin), stepped back 3.2; sections as columns as wide as the busiest cell, split into a front and a back bank (14 back, 2 up) when the row would pass 120 units; a `hub-section` **level label** (client name in its brand colour, the `label` param) at the left end of each level, the blueprint left of it; section headers label the columns on the ground in front |
| Devices | phone (ground), tablet, desktop as three arcs, one level each, stepped back |

Applying a flow (`src/arrange.js`) is one undoable history command that tweens position and rotation (wall-clock, 0.45 s), keeps the set's floor-plan centre where it was and frames the moved blocks when they land: Delivery through `host.ui.frameBlocks` (fill 0.85); the stacked flows (Audience, Compare, Site map, Devices) through `frameFrom`, the same fit from a 40° elevation with the Add rail and the flow bar kept clear (`ws.flyTo`, off-contract), so the levels do not hide each other. Framing a whole Delivery arc of 21 desktop cards puts the camera past the core's LOD distance; the live layer therefore decides by on-screen size (a card ≥ 44 px wide may carry a frame), not by LOD, and the demos open on the front of the arc.

## Adding a client

Either add an entry to `CLIENTS` in `src/clients.js` (slug, name, brand, lang, base URL, industry, roles, and the page list: section → route, title, role, device), or drop a `hub-blueprint` on the canvas, fill in the client, slug, brand and base URL, untick sections you do not need and click **Generate pages**. An unknown slug gets the template's default routes (`src/template.js › DEFAULT_ROUTES`) under the base URL with status `planned`; set the blueprint's status to `live` once the hub exists.

## Seams used off-contract, and a proposal

Everything the SDK offers is used through `host` (nodes, icons, draw, theme, menu, panel section, toasts, frameBlocks, examples, storage, selection, world/engine hooks). The live layer, the flows and generation also reach the core through `window.__proto`, which the drift guard allows (it scans imports) but the contract test does not cover:

* `window.__proto.ws.{renderer, camera, controls, flyTo, onCameraSwap}` — to size and render the CSS3D layer with the core camera, to fly to a face, to leave interact mode on a canvas pointerdown.
* `window.__proto.world.nodes` (read per frame), `node.face.{mesh, cw, ch}`, `node.lod`, `node.getAABB()` — face transforms, LOD and frustum tests.
* `window.__proto.{createInstance, cmd, history}` — creating the generated pages as one undoable command; `history.execute` for the flow moves.
* `window.__proto.sizes.face.pxPerUnit`, `window.__proto.THREE` (only checked; the add-on imports `three` itself through the page's import map).

**Proposed SDK seam: `host.view`.** With the following the add-on drops the escape hatch entirely:

```js
host.view.camera            // getter: the current camera (perspective or orthographic)
host.view.onCameraSwap(cb)  // → off
host.view.viewport          // the #viewport element; host.view.size() → { width, height } in CSS px
host.view.onFrame(cb(dt))   // per-frame hook after the core update, before render → off
host.view.flyTo(position, target, duration?) / host.view.faceOf(node) → { position, quaternion, scale, cw, ch, visible, lod }
host.view.onCanvasPointerDown(cb) → off
host.commands.addNodes(defs → [{ typeId, title, params, position }]) / removeNodes(nodes) / moveNodes(nodes, positions, { animate }) — undoable, returned as commands for host.history.execute / composite
host.sizes                  // the frozen theme sizes (face.pxPerUnit)
```
